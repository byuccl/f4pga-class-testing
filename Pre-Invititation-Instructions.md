# symbiflow-class-testing
This is the page for use by the professors/student researchers for the Symbiflow testing we will be doing starting Winter 2022 in our classes using Symbiflow-examples.

# Student Instructions
There are a few steps of setup that must be completed to prepare.

## Step 1: Wait for a Classroom Invitation and Set Up Your Github Directory in Linux
1. You will receive an invitation to your email for a Github Classroom assignment called 220 or 323 (depending on which class you are currently in).  Accept the  assignment invitation.
2. On the page it takes you to, refresh a time or two and eventually it will tell you "You're Ready to Go!".  The link it gives below that is the link for your Github repository you will use for all of your testing activities.  So, save the name somewhere.
3. Now, click on the name of your assignment repository.
4. Near the bottom of the screen will be an "Import" button.  Click it.
5. Now, enter this address of the repository you want as the starting point for your repository: https://github.com/byuccl/symbiflow-class-testing.  Hit, the tab key and then click "Begin Import".
6. When the import is done it will give you a link to your new repository - click it.
7. At this point you will be looking at THESE instructions but now they are in
8. It will give you the address of a new github repository it has created for you of the form: https://github.com/BYU-Symbiflow-Classrooms/220-yourName.  Click on that link.
9. It will then take you to a screen with a Quick Setup section at the top.  In that Quick Setup section it will have an address of the form git@github.com:BYU-Symbiflow-Classrooms/220-yourName.git - copy that address. 
10. Now, log into a Digital Lab Machine and type: `git clone link` where `link` is the address you copied above.  It will create a directory on the Linux machine names `220-yourName`.  That is where you will do all your work.
