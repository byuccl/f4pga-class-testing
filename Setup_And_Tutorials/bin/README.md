# readme.py #

This simple script will make it easier for you to create your  `README.md` for each lab.

To use the script, run the command `python3 ~/f4pga-class-testing/bin/readme.py` in a Linux terminal while inside the individual lab folder you want to create a `README.md` for.

The first argument `python3` tells the terminal we are launching a python program.  
The `~/f4pga-class-testing/bin/readme.py` tells the terminal where the program is. You will have to change this to match where it is stored in your computer.  

Then type in responses to the prompts. Pressing enter will submit the response.  

## Notes ##

- You can paste in command line with `CTRL + SHIFT + V` and copy with `CTR + SHIFT + C`
- If you end the program with `CTRL+C` or by closing the window, it will not save your progress.  
- If you run it again, it will overwrite the previous README.md file.  
- You can leave answers blank by pressing enter.  
- Upper case YES means its default, just press enter for yes.
