# Program Description
The Configurable Computing Lab research group here in the department is involved in some open source development projects targeting the creation of FPGA design tools.  The overall project name is Symbiflow and researchers and developers from around the world are contributing to it.

At this point a complete FPGA design flow that goes from Verilog/SystemVerilog files to a finished .bit file is now in place and can be accessed via Github at https://github.com/symbiflow/symbiflow-examples.

As a part of this project the developers have asked (and Google has provided student funding) for us to conduct a study wherein we solicit student designs to be run through the design tool flow to test it on a variety of outside designs.  

We are thus soliciting students in our ECEn 220 and ECEN 323 courses this semester to consider joining the project as research participants.  We want to make it clear that this it NOT an official part of your enrollment in either of these classes and that your participation (or lack thereof) will not affect your grade or standing in the class in any way.

In short, if you choose to participate your tasks will be the following:
1. Following the instructions provided (and with the assistance of research students we have designated for this project), you will install the Symbiflow tool flow into your account on the digital lab Linux machines.  
2. Then, for each lab you complete and pass off in 220, you will re-compile your designs using the open source Symbiflow FPGA tools.
3. If the compilation is successful, you will test the resulting .bit file on your FPGA board and report the results of the testing.
4. If the compilation is not successful, you will confer with the research students to confirm that the compilation failure was not the result of your own error in installing or running the Symbfiflow tools.  Once that is confirmed, you will then report the failure reported by the tools.

In all of this you will consent to have the research students collect your design files, compilation log files, and your short description of success/failure for use in our identifying issues with the Symbiflow tools.

By participating you will also learn a significant amount regarding Linux, Github, and the git source code control system.  You will also gain additional experience with your FPGA board.

It is anticipated that the time required for your participation will include approximately 30-60 minutes to install the tool flow at the start of the project and then 15-30 minutes for each lab (the first one may take a bit longer as you are getting familiar with running the Symbiflow tools, later ones should take no more than 15 minutes).  And, as mentioned above, there will be designated research students available to walk you through the process and help any time you have questions. 

# Financial Incentives to Participate

As compensation for your participation in this research study you will be provided Cougar Cash, credited to your BYU account at the end of the semester.  

You will receive $25 for the initial installation and verifying that the tools work, and then $25 for each lab assignment you run through the tools and provide a results report on (we anticipate there will be about 7 such labs).  At any rate, your maximum compensation for participating will be capped at $200.

To receive credit there will be a due date attached to each lab (typically a week after the due date that you were supposed to pass it off for your normal class activities).  This will allow the research students to gather the results lab by lab rather than having all of the results dumped on them at the end of the semester.

Finally, note that you need not complete all the labs to receive compensation.  If you complete the installation and report on 4 of the labs you would receive $125, for example.

# To Get Started
To get started, you merely need to go to [this page](../Setup_And_Tutorial.md) and follow the instructions there.  Once you have created your repository you will show up in our collection of research participants and we will know you are involved.

# Getting Help
A set of research students have been hired to help with this.  We are calling them the "Symbiflow TA's" for this semester.

They are available via email to answer questions and/or meet with you in the lab to help.  We recommend you work with one as you install the tools and do your first lab - they are very knowledgeable about the installation and running processes (they have done them themselves) and can make completing the initial steps trivial to do.  

We will hold a couple of late-in-the-day help sessions to walk those interested throug the installation steps and running a first design through the tools to help.  Stay tuned for information on when those will be.

The Symbiflow TA's are:
- Student #1 and email
- Student #2 and email
- Student #3 and email
- Student #4 and email
- Student #5 and email
