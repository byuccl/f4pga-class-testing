# F4PGA Classroom - Program Description
The Configurable Computing Lab research group here in the department (Profs. Wirthlin and Goeders) are involved in some open source development projects targeting the creation of FPGA design tools.  The overall project name is *F4PGA* and researchers and developers from around the world are contributing to it.

At this point, a complete FPGA design flow that goes from Verilog/SystemVerilog files to a finished .bit file is now in place and can be accessed via Github at [https://github.com/chipsalliance/f4pga-examples](https://github.com/chipsalliance/f4pga-examples).

As a part of our work we have obtained student funding for us to solicit student designs to be run through the design tool flow to test it on a variety of outside designs.  

We are thus soliciting students in our ECEn 220 course this semester to consider joining the project as research participants.  We want to make it clear that (a) this it NOT an official part of your enrollment in either of these classes, (b) that your participation is strictly voluntary, and (c) that your participation (or lack thereof) will not affect your grade or standing in the class in any way.  However, we are paying students who decide to participate in the project (see compensation below).

To help you do this we have hired students to serve as *F4PGA TAs* this semester.  They will be available essentially any time to help you as you run your class designs through the F4PGA tools.

In short, if you choose to participate your tasks will be the following:
1. For each lab you complete and pass off in 220, you will re-compile your designs using the open source F4PGA tools.
2. If the compilation is successful, you will test the resulting .bit file on your FPGA board and report the results of the testing.
3. If the compilation is not successful, you will confer with a F4PGA TA to confirm that the compilation failure was not the result of your own error  running the F4PGA tools.  Once that is confirmed and if your design still cannot be processed by F4PGA, you will then document the failure reported by the tools.

In all of this you must consent to have the F4PGA TAs collect your design files, compilation log files, and your short description of success/failure for use in our identifying issues with the F4PGA tools.

By participating you will also learn a significant amount regarding Linux, Github, and git. You will also gain additional experience with your FPGA board.

It is anticipated that the time required for your participation will include approximately 30 minutes to do the initial setup and explanation and then approximately 15 minutes for each lab (the first one may take a bit longer as you are getting familiar with running the F4PGA tools, later ones should take less). And, as mentioned above, there will be F4PGA TAs available to walk you through the process and help any time you have questions. 

# Financial Incentives to Participate

As compensation for your participation in this research study you will be provided Cougar Cash, credited to your BYU account, at the end of the semester.  Note that you are NOT being hired as BYU employees to participate in this. Rather, you are being compensated for your time as *research participants* in this research study.  Thus, you will not have to go through the hiring process or record your time.

The compensation plan is the following:
- You will receive $25 for each lab assignment you run through the tools (the specific labs you will be asked to run through the tools will be specified and do not include every single lab in your class).
- If you complete at least 3 labs, you will receive an extra $25 to compensate you for your time setting up the tools at the outset.
- If you complete 6 labs, you will receive an extra $25 bonus.
- If you have been doing the math, the total compensation you can receive for your participation is $200.

# Due Dates
To receive credit there will be a due date attached to each lab. These due dates will be communicated to you but will typically be a week after the due date that you were supposed to pass it off for your normal class activities (but the first few will be delayed to give you time to get set up).  Having such a schedule will allow the F4PGA TAs to gather the results lab-by-lab rather than having all of the results dumped on them at the end of the semester.

Finally, note that you need not complete all the labs to receive compensation. For example, 4 of the labs you would receive $125.

# Work Environment
You will do all your work on the digital lab machines, working out of your own CAEDM home directory.  Since the F4PGA tools have no graphics associated with them, you can work remotely using SSH if you desire.

# To Get Started
- A getting started session will be held on September 26 at 5pm in the Digital Lab. Professor Wirthlin will walk you through the entire setup process and the F4PGA TAs will be roaming the room to help you get everything set up correctly. This will minimize the time you spend getting everything set up.
- But, if you cannot attend the _TBD_ session, you can go to [this page](../Setup_And_Tutorials/Step1_Creating_Repository.md) and follow the instructions there.  

Either way, once you have created your Github repository you will show up in our collection of research participants and we will know you are involved.

# Getting Help and Staying in Touch - Please Join Slack Workspace NOW!
The F4PGA TAs will be available in person and via zoom to answer questions and/or meet with you in the lab to help. But, the best way to get help from them is to use the Slack Workspace we have set up for this. To join the slack workspace click this link: https://join.slack.com/t/symbiflow-classroom/shared_invite/zt-11tul5h0m-eMf62qHBJyqZLkyjursWPQ. Once you are in, join the 220 channel.

We anticipate some amount of communicaton with you as the semester progresses. Therefore, you MUST closely follow the Slack channel during the semester so we can feed you needed information as the semester progresses. Otherwise, you may waste a lot of time making the same mistakes we have documented on the Slack channel.

We strongly suggest downloading the Slack app to recieve notification and updates about the project, though it is possible to just use Slack through a web browser.
