# Symbiflow-class-testing
We are glad you are joining our research project by testing your FPGA designs using the Symbiflow tools.  This past contains needed instructions for the project.

1. Your first step to get set up is to create Github account and repository.  You can find instructions for doing so [here](Step1_Creating_Repository.md).

2. Your second step to get set up is to install and test the Symbiflow tools.  You can find instructions for doing so [here](Step2_Installing_Testing.md).

3. Finally, you can now move on to testing your own designs.  Instructions for this can be found [here](Step3_Testing_Your_Own_Designs.md).
