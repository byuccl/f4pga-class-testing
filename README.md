# symbiflow-class-testing
This is the page for use by the professors/student researchers for the Symbiflow testing we will be doing starting Winter 2022 in our classes using Symbiflow-examples.

# Student Instructions
There are a few steps of setup that must be completed to prepare.

## Step 1: Wait for a Classroom Invitation and Set Up Your Github Directory in Linux
1. You will receive an invitation to your email for a Github Classroom assignment called 220 or 323 (depending on which class you are currently in).  Accept the  invitation.
2. It will give you the address of a new github repository it has created for you of the form: https://github.com/BYU-Symbiflow-Classrooms/220-yourName.  Click on that link.
3. It will then take you to a screen with a Quick Setup section at the top.  In that Quick Setup section it will have an address of the form git@github.com:BYU-Symbiflow-Classrooms/220-yourName.git - copy that address. 
4. Now, log into a Digital Lab Machine and type: `git clone link` where `link` is the address you copied above.  It will create a directory on the Linux machine names `220-yourName`.  That is where you will do all your work.
